1. Polymorphism means multiform or "many shapes" (Greek). 

2. When we apply polymorphism to OO design it allows the object to decide (by using a different parameter) on what form the method will use.
public void disconnect(Desktop desktop){
    devicesDesktop.remove(desktop);
}
public void disconnect(Printer printer){
    devicesPrinter.remove(printer);
}

3. Abstract classes and interfaces

4. As many as we like

5. Onomatopoeistic method applied to different animals.

6. Composition is a technique that implements relationship between classes and objects.

7. When one object belongs to another. For example a collection of books in a library. A book would belong to the library.

8. Can control the visibility of other object to client classes and reuse only what is needed.

9. It can't exists without the existence of that object.
